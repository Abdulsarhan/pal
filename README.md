## Simple Cross platform multimedia library for windowing, input, sound and OpenGL context creation.
This Library is primary designed for people who want to make video games, but it is possible to make
other kinds of graphical applications using this library. Currently, this library only works on Windows.
I am currently working on linux support for both X11 and Wayland.
I can't support mac at the moment because I don't have a macbook.

## Dependencies
glad (optional, but highly recommended)

## Todo
* Mac support.
* Linux support.
* Actually make the library single-header.
* Better Sound & Music API & More features.
* Support for all gamepads. (or as many can be reasonably supported).
