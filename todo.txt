Integrate gamepad system into the window events.
Some functions return 0 on success, others return 1. Audit each function and make sure that all of them return 1 on success and 0 on failure.

Later:

Fully integrate new gamepad system that supports all gamepads.
Implement linux_x11_platform.h.
Implement linux_wayland_platform.h
