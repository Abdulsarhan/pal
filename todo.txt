Now:

Load OpenGL functions dynamically so that the user does not have to explicitly link against 5 graphics apis just to complile this shit.

Don't include the headers directly, only use what you need.
Add dark mode detection for windows and linux.
Finish implementing all the events and window flags.
Integrate gamepad system into the window events.

Create a replacement for all cstdlib functions that we use.
Make error codes more consistent. Some functions return 0 on success, others return 1.

Later:
Fully integrate new gamepad system that supports all gamepads.
Finish implementing pal's API on linux_x11 and linux_wayland.
